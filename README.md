## 1. Introduction to Precision Medicine
Definition of Precision Medicine: Tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.

To advance the field, current genomics and machine learning researchers need to address:

- identifying genetic or molecular markers for clinical phenotypes
- discovering disease subtypes from genetic and/or molecular data
- building prediction models for clinical events based on electronic medical record (EMR) data

> Let's look at an example where scientists used the theory of precision medicine to study asthma.
