## 1. Introduction to Precision Medicine
Definition of Precision Medicine (by Dr. Su-In Lee): Tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.

In other words, precision medicine should account for personal variations in genomic sequence and environmental exposure.

> Here is a story of how scientists used precision medicine to treat breast cancer.

In the old paradigm, cancer types are usually distinguished by the origin of tumors. For example, lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer.

However, tumors with the same origin may be different in appearance and behavior, aggressiveness, and vulnerability. Thus we need to treat each kind of tumor differently.

The early treatment of breast cancer in the 1970s:
- All patients underwent removal of ovaries: The assumption was, no estrogen, no growth of tumor.
- It only helped around 70% of patients with ER+ tumor.
- But how tumor cells are built matters: For example, markers on tumor cell surface and growth circuits can lead to different tumor progression.

Then a discovery in 1970 found that:
- 70% of breast cancer are ER (estrogen-receptor) positive.
- These patients can be treated with anti-estrogen agent to block cancer growth.
> A much better treatment, but what about the remaining 30% of the patients?
 
1984 discovery:
- 20% of breast cancers have abnormal HER-2 gene expression.
- A new drug, Herceptin, was developed to inhibit the function of this protein.

Mid-1990s findings:
- 5% of breast cancers have inherited defect in gene BRCA1 or BRCA2.
- No preventive treatment, but can screen for such inborn defect and watch for tumor formation closely.

Fortunately, the treatments using anti-estrogen agent or Herceptin can be effective for around 85% of the breast cancer patients. This improvement in cancer therapy is largely contributed to the effort to split the patients into different subgroups, then treat each subgroup on its own based on its distinct characteristics. That is the core of precision medicine. We will see how scientists implement this "splitting" in the next section as well.

Note that the 5% of breast cancer with inherited defect in gene BRCA1 or BRCA2, are categoried as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). This type of breast cancer does not express the genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2. And it is still in need of an effective treatment.

In order to develop personalized treatment and advance the field of precision medicine, current genomics and machine learning researchers need to address:

- identifying genetic or molecular markers for clinical phenotypes
- discovering disease subtypes from genetic and/or molecular data
- building prediction models for clinical events based on electronic medical record (EMR) data

> Let's look at an example where scientists used the theory of precision medicine to study asthma.

## 2. Personalized Medicine through the Lens of Asthma

#### 1) What is Asthma?
A condition where a person's lungs become inflamed, and produce extra mucus, making it hard to breath. 

Biology behind asthma: An excessive allergen-induced type 2 inflammation, orchestrated by memory CD4+ T cells that produce type 2 cytokines (Th2 cells).

In a similar disease, rhinitis, its pathway also involves Th2 cells.

But unfortunately, there is currently no cure for asthma. Newer therapies are only partially successful in certain subtypes.

Thus we need a better understanding of the disease at a molecular level.

#### 2) A precision medicine study on asthma 

The figure below shows how scientists split the asthma patients into 4 subgroups. 

They took into account 8 parameters obtained from patients that were correlated with their disease and the severity, and did a partition-around-medoids clustering.

In the study, *Transcriptional profiling of Th2 cells identifies pathogenic features associated with asthma*, the researchers performed RNA-Seq on Th2 cells from a total of 80 samples from 77 patients, including 3 biological replicates.

Then they did RNA-Seq analysis to identify genes differentially expressed between allergic asthma, rhinitis and healthy control groups, by performing negative binomial tests for pairwise comparisons employing the Bioconductor package DESeq2.

They found the following:

- They identified a total of 15 distinct gene modules.
- DESeq analysis found 500 genes differentially expressed between asthmatic subjects and healthy subjects (Genes for apoptosis, zinc transporters, MAPK, NF-κB, TNF).
- The expression of most of these genes was similar between rhinitis and asthma.
- Genes that differentiate asthmatic from healthy subjects show an intermediate phenotype in allergic rhinitis subjects.

These genetic markers identified through this study could offer insights for personalized medicine for asthma patients.

## 3. Current Hot Topics on Precision Medicine

> The study of precision medicine has gained an increased interest in the scientific community in the past decade. Some interesting work are presented as follows.

#### 1) Mapping of patients data

Atul Butte, a Distinguished Professor and the Director of the Computational Health Sciences Institute at UCSF, constructed a map illustrating how each individual patient developed different subtypes of diseases and how these diseases lead to mortality. 

Here is the map showing the paths for each patient:

Each square and circle represent a certain subtype of disease, and each line represents a transition. 

![map](https://github.com/miko-798/BENG_183_mini_lecture/blob/master/map.png)

This map offers physicians and scientists possible patterns of disease progression, which can help guide the treatments for future patients. Clearly, this is one way to *build prediction models for clinical events based on electronic medical record (EMR) data*. The amount of detailed information encompassed by this map is powerful and grants possibility for precision care for patients.
 
> Let's look at another application of precision medicine.

#### 2) Opening the black box of machine learning models

Su-In Lee, an Associate Professor at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at UW, found weaknesses in the conventional way to identify molecular markers. She tries to interpret the complex machine learning models that are used to analyze patient data, and strives to offer individualized explanations for a particular prediction, and for a particular patient.

These are both very interesting and cutting edge research efforts in the field of precision medicine. So what's next in precision medicine? Well, let's keep in mind the three things that scientists may want to address:

- identifying genetic or molecular markers for clinical phenotypes
- discovering disease subtypes from genetic and/or molecular data
- building prediction models for clinical events based on electronic medical record (EMR) data

Whether it be cancer vaccines or personalized drugs for a particular subtype of cancer, the biomedical research community will witness a growth in precision cancer care. We all have the potential to make what's next.
